## Day 1

Initiating ipython shell in terminal ```ipython```

Initiating Jupyter notebook in terminal ```jupyter notebook```

```help(len)``` = ```len?```

To get the source code ```len??```

Both of this even works for the functions you have created.

Tab completion is awesome. ```len.<tab>```

Tab completion is great in conjunction with ```from pandas import <tab>``` and ```import <tab>``` to list out the objects and libraries.

```*``` with ```?``` for wildcard matching. ```*warning?``` and ```str.*find*?```
